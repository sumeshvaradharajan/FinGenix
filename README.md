## Overview

*FinGenix* is a powerful tool designed to simplify and enhance decision-making in the financial sector using data. It allows users to interact with both CSV data and MySQL databases using natural language queries. Leveraging the capabilities of the Llama 3 language model, FinGenix transforms your natural language prompts into precise SQL or Python queries, providing accurate and insightful results.

## Features

- *Natural Language Processing:* Type your query in plain English, and FinGenix will generate the corresponding SQL or Python code.
- *Versatile Data Sources:* Connect to MySQL databases or upload CSV files to start analyzing your data.
- *Intuitive Interface:* A user-friendly Streamlit interface to make data querying accessible to everyone.
- *Result Beautification:* Get your query results in a clear and structured format, making it easy to interpret and act upon.

## How It Works

1. *Schema Extraction:* For MySQL, the schema of the database is extracted to help formulate accurate queries.
2. *Query Refinement:* The userâ€™s natural language query is refined using the fine tuned Llama 3 language model to generate precise SQL or Python code.
3. *Query Execution:* The refined query is executed on the connected data source (MySQL or CSV).
4. *Result Beautification:* The raw results are transformed into a human-readable format using LLM.

## Fine-Tuned Model

To ensure the highest accuracy and relevance in query results, the Llama 3 model used in FinGenix has been fine-tuned specifically for financial data analysis. This fine-tuning process involved training the model on a comprehensive dataset of financial queries and databases, allowing it to understand and process financial terminology and concepts with greater precision.

| Model Type         | Average Perplexity | Average BLEU | Average ROUGE-1 | Average ROUGE-L |
|:-------------------|-------------------:|-------------:|----------------:|----------------:|
| Base LLaMA-3       |               2.80 |         0.51 |            0.67 |            0.67 |

These metrics demonstrate the improvements achieved through fine-tuning, showing enhanced performance across various evaluation criteria. For further details on the fine-tuning methodology and dataset used, please refer to the documentation provided in the repository.

## Example

### MySQL

 ```bash
host = "your_host"
user = "your_user"
password = "your_password"
database = "your_database"
user_prompt = "Show me the top 10 customers by sales."

result = execute_mysql_query(host, user, password, database, user_prompt, llm)
print(result)
```

### CSV

```bash
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("your_file.csv")
user_prompt = "What is the average sales amount?"

result = chat_with_csv(df, user_prompt)
print(result)
```
